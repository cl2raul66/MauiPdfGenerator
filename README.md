# MauiPdfGenerator

## Introduction

MauiPdfGenerator is a powerful and flexible library for .NET MAUI that allows you to generate PDF documents directly in your applications. It offers a fluent API for easy document construction, comprehensive content elements, and flexible styling options. This library is complemented by `MauiPdfGenerator.SourceGenerators`, a code generator that simplifies font management by providing compile-time safe aliases for both standard PDF fonts and custom fonts registered in your MAUI application. Together, they provide a robust solution for creating, modifying, and managing PDFs easily, enhancing your app's functionality and user experience.

## Features

### MauiPdfGenerator

- **Easily create PDF documents:** Quickly and easily generate PDFs in your .NET MAUI applications.
- **Flexible content:** Add pages, text, images, lines, and organize content in vertical or horizontal stacks for clear and attractive layouts.
- **Visual customization:** Adjust text styles, fonts, sizes, and colors for each element.
- **Document configuration:** Add metadata such as title or author and control the appearance of each page.
- **Compatible and efficient:** Works on all platforms supported by .NET MAUI and allows you to save PDFs asynchronously to avoid blocking the app.

### MauiPdfGenerator.SourceGenerators

- **Automatic font management:** Automatically detects and generates safe aliases for all fonts registered in your MAUI project.
- **Standard and custom fonts:** Easily access both standard PDF fonts and any custom fonts you register.
- **Avoid typos:** Use compile-time generated constants to prevent errors from misspelled font names.
- **Simplifies font usage:** Makes working with fonts in PDF generation easier and safer.

These features make both projects complementary, but each provides independent and useful functionality for generating and customizing PDFs in .NET MAUI.
